SimpleBallPaddle
================

A simple program in C++ that shows a paddle following a randomized ball

This is a programming assignment for my Imperative programming class.

* The program needs to use an abstract class called GObject.

* The ball and racket/paddle should inherit the GObject class.

* The ball has to move randomly and should bounce of the x and y boundries.

* The racket/paddle should move left to right, right to left, in the same y position at all times. The racket should also follow the ball and force the ball to bounce in the middle position, so that the ball never touches the bottom of the window.

Graphics library

The library used in this program in graphics.h
I have added a the files that need to be installed and link to a video on youtube on how to install the library.
